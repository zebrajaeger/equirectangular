# equirectangular

## Overview
This is a tool to wrap spherical panoramic images (esp. from Kolor Autopano, http://www.kolor.com/) 
with a border to make it equirectangular.

## Why should i do this?
The tool krPano (http://krpano.com/) can generate a viewer to see the panoramic images in a first-person view.
But when the images are not equirectangular, it creates a flash-based viewer. Otherwise a htlm(5) only player
(and a flash player too).
This tool makes krPano able to generate a htlm5-multiresolution-partial-pano that is viewable on Desktop, smartphone etc.

# Which image-formats are supported?
Photoshop PSD and PSB Files (http://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/)
